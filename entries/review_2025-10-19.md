## Review Notes

- Five high-priority catalog entries now have TEL-5 compliant versioned scaffolds, manifests, and citation shells.
- All generated directories validate cleanly with `python -m scripts.tervyx validate …`; evidence and simulation payloads remain placeholders until ingestion runs.
- Catalog statuses for these entries were updated to `in_progress` with manual CLI provenance notes for downstream tracking.
