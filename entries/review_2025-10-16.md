## Review Notes

- All five builds use the updated CLI pipeline which now records masked J* scores, TEL-5 metadata, and compact audit hashes compatible with the entry schema.
- `python scripts/tervyx.py validate …` now passes cleanly after updating the schema validator to require `tel5_tiers` instead of the legacy HBV tiers block.
- Audit log entries now include both the compact `0x` hash and the full SHA-256 digest for downstream traceability.
